# 🔐 Hello-mTLS

### End-to-End Mutual TLS Demo in Python and OpenSSL

> **Author:** Bob
> **Date:** October 2025
> **Keywords:** TLS 1.3 · X.509 · PKI · Zero Trust · Service Identity

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **fully working implementation of mutual TLS (mTLS)** — the same authentication pattern used inside Kubernetes, service meshes, and zero-trust architectures.

I built everything from scratch: a local Certificate Authority, client and server certificates, and a Python HTTPS server that enforces bidirectional certificate validation. The goal was to internalize how real secure channels work — not just use them.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Most engineers know how to connect over HTTPS. Few understand *why* it works.
This project proves that:

* Encryption ≠ Authentication — you need both.
* Trust begins with certificate issuance and signature verification.
* Mutual authentication is the foundation of zero-trust networks.

Concepts mastered:

| Area                    | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **TLS 1.3 handshake**   | ClientHello, ServerHello, key exchange, session keys |
| **X.509 certificates**  | Structure, SAN validation, CA chain                  |
| **mTLS**                | Mutual authentication using private keys             |
| **OpenSSL tooling**     | Key generation, CSR signing, CA lifecycle            |
| **Operational hygiene** | Port management, cleanup, Makefile automation        |

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/hello-mtls.git
cd hello-mtls
make clean && make all && make run
```

Expected output:

```
🔒 Server listening on https://localhost:4443 ...
🌐 Attempting mTLS connection...
✅ Connection succeeded: mutual TLS verified!
✅ mTLS verified between client and server.
```

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **OpenSSL**                     | Certificate authority and signing  |
| **Python 3 (ssl, http.server)** | HTTPS server requiring client auth |
| **cURL**                        | mTLS test client                   |
| **Makefile**                    | Full automation of PKI lifecycle   |

## 📖 What I Learned

* How the **TLS 1.3 handshake** exchanges keys and negotiates ciphers.
* How **SAN (hostname) validation** prevents impersonation.
* How to **debug TLS errors** (`error 60`, handshake failures).
* Why **short-lived, automatable certificates** are vital for large systems.
* How SPIFFE/SPIRE automates everything I built manually here.

# 💬 Final Reflection

> *Authenticate → Authorize → Attest → Prove → Revoke.*

Mutual TLS gives services a verifiable identity — the foundation of all secure, autonomous systems.
